          <h1>Initial Ideas</h1>
          <p>First, a little about the general school project this was created for.
            The project was a requirement for all gr 12s to complete, and
            involved having a mentor, self-learning and completing a
            presentation about the final project and the journey we took.
            We worked on developing several soft skills through that journey
            and generally experienced the process that setting, working towards
            and achieving a goal could take.</p>

          <p>I took this opportunity to delve into making a full
          animation with a storyline. I had done a couple of smaller
          animations on my iPad, mostly to explore the software and see
          what animating on it was like.</p>

          <h2>Previous Animations</h2>

          <p>Simple kick animation</p>
          <video width = "600px" controls>
            <source src="../media/InitialIdeasMedia/KickAnimation.MP4" type="video/MP4">
            Kick animation
          </video>

          <p>Two characters throwing a ball background, from when
            I tried animating characters interacting with each other.
            The sizes of the characters change, but hey, it looks ok!
          </p>
          <video width = "600px" controls>
            <source src="../media/InitialIdeasMedia/ThrowBall.MP4" type="video/MP4">
          </video>

          <h2>Birth of the Marbles</h2>
          <p>And some random doodles led to these marbles being born:
            <div class="beside">
              <img width = "400px" src="../media/InitialIdeasMedia/FirstBlueMarble.PNG" alt="first design of blue marble">
              <img width = "400px" src="../media/InitialIdeasMedia/FirstPurpleMarble.PNG" alt="first design of purple marble">
            </div>
          </p>

          <p>Combine that with the main project, and some ideas began to form.
            (Also marbles would be pretty easy to animate. Because, well, they’re round and
             I wouldn’t have to worry about limbs)</p>

          <p>My initial ideas included a short, but well meaning storyline that left a
            good message without physical words. (Brainstorming included a lot of watching
             shorts on YouTube)</p>

          <p>And after a couple of scrapped ideas, I landed on having two marbles (based on
            those doodles before) as the main characters. One would get cracked somehow, and wouldn’t
            be too excited about the new imperfections. Then sunlight, somehow, somewhere would shine on the marble
            and, well, light through a cracked glass marble is actually really pretty. And that’s it. That’s the general
            idea process leading to my animation.</p>
