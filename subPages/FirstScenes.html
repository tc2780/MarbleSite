        <h1>First Scenes</h1>

        <p>Before any animating could be done, I had to draw the backgrounds.
          In total, there were only 3 different ones, which made this process
          easier and quicker. I also had to decide on an art style for the
          animation, and as I was drawing everything by hand, it ended up
          being pretty simple. That also meant redesigning the marbles so
          they fit in with the backgrounds.</p>

          <h2>Backgrounds</h2>

          <div class="beside">
            <div >
              <p>Desk</p>
              <img src="../media/FirstScenesMedia/BG_Desk.png" alt="desk background" width = "300px">
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>Side of desk (falling scenes)</p>
              <img src="../media/FirstScenesMedia/BG_Falling.png" alt="falling background" width = "300px">
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>Ground</p>
              <img src="../media/FirstScenesMedia/BG_Ground.png" alt="ground background" width = "300px">
            </div>
          </div>


          <h2>Marbles: Redesigned</h2>

          <div class="beside">
            <img src="../media/FirstScenesMedia/BlueRedesigned.PNG" alt="redesigned blue marble" width = "400px">
            <img src="../media/FirstScenesMedia/PurpleRedesigned.PNG" alt="redesigned purple marble" width = "400px">
          </div>

          <h2>Very First Animated Scene (kind of)</h2>
            <p>The very first thing I animated was the butterfly that was
              supposed to come in and tip the blue marble. It consisted of a total of
              7 different butterfly positions that were repeated to look like flapping.</p>

              <p>The first version of the butterfly flapping</p>
              <img src="../media/FirstScenesMedia/Butterfly_Merged.gif" alt="gif of butterfly flapping" width = "350px">

              <p>The final frames used</p>
              <img src="../media/FirstScenesMedia/ButterflyFrames.jpg" alt="frames of the butterfly" width = "500px">

            <p>From there, it was pretty straightforward. There was a lot of fiddling with the fps
              and stuff like motion blurs that helped with making the marbles look like theyâ€™re
              moving. A lot.</p>
