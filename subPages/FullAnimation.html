          <p>And here it is! The final animation, titled The Marble</p>
          <div class="">
            <video width="800px" controls>
              <source src="../media/MarbleAnimation.MP4" type="video/mp4">
            Sorry, the video doesn't seem to be working :(
            </video>
          </div>

          <p>There are definitely some things to improve on though.
            For one thing, glass doesn’t exactly crack as I drew it. For
            another, the music is just.. It’s not good. I ended up running
            out of time towards the end, so I ended up using default music
            from iMovie and Premiere Rush. Also the fps for most of my
            animation is (if I remember correctly) 6 fps, and the usual
            rates are typically in the double digits (although the main reason
            was the overwhelming time pressure). So that’s also something to
            keep in mind in terms of how this project went down.</p>

          <p>Overall though, I’m happy with how everything turned out.
            The final animation is pretty good considering I was (and
            still am) a complete beginner, and it’s something I’m proud
            to show to others.</p>

           <p>And that’s it! Thanks for making it this far! I
             wrote a lot more than I intended since this project was
             mainly to practice my coding skills. Till next time!</p>
