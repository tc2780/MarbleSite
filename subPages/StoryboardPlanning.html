        <h1>Storyboard Planning</h1>
        <p>Once I had a general idea, I decided to make a storyboard. Mostly to plan out what kind of scenes
  and backgrounds I wanted to make, but also partly because it made everything seem more official.</p>

        <img src="../media/Storyboard.JPG" alt="a donut" class = "storyPic" width = "700px">

        <p>I did not animate on a continuous file, and the colours used above showed how I planned
           to separate the scenes before putting it all together.</p>

        <p>During the process of creating the storyboard, I also decided to focus on animating expressions
          as it was the only thing that indicated the emotions and thoughts the marbles were going through.
          It also allowed me to narrow down how many backgrounds I wanted and where the entire thing would be set.</p>
